[JRE, JDK,JVM]
JVM====Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, loads, verifies and executes Java bytecode.


Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is a set of software tools responsible for execution of the Java program or application on your system.If a programmer would like to execute a Java program using the Java command, they should install JRE. If they are only installing (and not developing or compiling code), then only JRE is needed.

JDK contains all the tools required to compile, debug and run a program developed using the Java platform. (Itâ€™s worth noting that Java programs can also be run using command line.
JDK includes all the Java tools, executables and binaries needed to run Java programs. This includes JRE, a compiler, a debugger, an archiver and other tools that are used in Java development.

JVM IS PART OF JRE

IT MEANS THAT JDK IS PARENT AND AND JRE IS CHILD AND JVM IS CHILD OF JRE.

JVM PROVIDES A VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR THE PROGRAM TO LOAD.
JRE PROVIDES THE ENVIRONMENT TO EXECUTE THE VIRTUAL MACHINE
